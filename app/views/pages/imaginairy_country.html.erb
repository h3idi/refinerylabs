	  	Angelaâ€™s unfinished documentary film (in the making) is a story of what it is like to grow up a immigrant child hearing about her parents country Chile as a child in the 80-ies. The film portraits the imaginary counter of heroes and villans from a childs perspective where the lines get blurred. As a grown up she later investigates the land of her childhood stories to interview people behind the massacre in Chile in short he artful, and powerfully strong and objective interviews. <br>
		<br>
		We tried to make a compelling fast spread Facebook app that rhymed with the  80-ids expressions that she grew up with. We chose to use the Start wars hero esthetique to portrait the hero characteristics in a simple Facebook - who is your hero personality test, as seen popularly on Facebook. We aimed to be easily digested - but thru the characteristics that you end up with after a personality test very similar to the heroes and villains of reality (in chile during the 70-ties) the user ends up with a Starwars hero, but also with a wider perspective of 4 other real life heroes.<br>
		<br>
		A bit cheeky to pull people in on a feel good personality test for heroes that later turns in to a heave subject like the chilean dictature of Pinochet reality. <br>
		<br>
		We programed a simple mobile app (its so mobile it only works on mobile - does not support web in this iteration). <br>
